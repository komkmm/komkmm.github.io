I'm a machine learning researcher especially focusing in generative model such as Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs). Recent research topic has been few-shot image generation, which covers constraint that only given few-shot training data. I’m also interested in image-to-image translation, text-to-image generation, and other computer vision task such as object detection.
